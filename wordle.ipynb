    "# Wordle Solver in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By Yicheng Shen & Linxuan Wang\n",
    "\n",
    "Our function works in a way that it accepts a `wordle.puzzle()` object, automatically guesses up to 6 times, and breaks once it guesses correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "We choose \"plaid\" as the initial guess based on our domain knowledge. There are many potentially well-performing first guesses, such as \"react\", \"salet\", \"other\", etc. The rule of thumb is to have words with common letters and vowels. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each round, we store the positions at which \"🟩\"/\"🟨\"/\"⬜\" appears in the guess result as well as the corresponding letters. We also record and update letters that were guesses correctly and incorrectly. Bascially, our funtion looks up the list of possible words (starting from the full word bank). It would select words that have the correct letters in the \"🟩\" positions, have letters indicated in by \"🟨\" but not in those positions, and don't have letters that are ruled out by \"⬜\". After these three rounds of filtering, the possbile guesses left should all fit the criterion from previous results. \n",
    "\n",
    "After each guess we narrow down the list of possible answers based on information we stored. We pick a word among the highest commonality to be the next guess. The commonality is determined based on the frequency of each letter at each position among the remaining possible guesses. The intuition is to choose a common word whose letters appear \"frequently\" and is likely to be the answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also notice that most common failures of solving the wordle puzzles usually happen when the solver has confirmed four or three \"🟩\" letters and positions, but is stuck by a long list of possible guesses to fill the remaining \"⬜\" positions. In response to this situation, we add a mechanism that would make a different guess to eliminate several letters at a time. The guess should be a word containing letters that did not appear in previous guesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our solver is able to solve random wordle puzzles approximately 90% of the time with an average number of guess being about 4.57. "
